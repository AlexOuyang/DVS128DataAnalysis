Run sc_barGen

%
% The code here demonstrates how you can generate a video stimulus, get a
% simulated retina spiking response to it, and display this response
% alongside the original stimulus.
%
% This can be useful if you'd like to experiment with an algorithm and see
% if it would work on the retina.  
%
% The simulated retina has not yet been tested against the real (silicon)
% retina for similar performance.
