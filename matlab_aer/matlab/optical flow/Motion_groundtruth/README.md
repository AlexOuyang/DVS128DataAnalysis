# Motion-Ground-Truth
Matlab functions to calculate ground truth visual motion estimates taking into account lens calibration

These functions show how to generate ground truth visual motion estimates taking into account camera calibration parameters.

Camera calibration for DVS cameras is done using code from 
http://www.garrickorchard.com/code

which in turn relies heavily on the Caltech Camera Calibration Toolbox, available from 
http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/

The script 'example.m' shows how to use the functions.
